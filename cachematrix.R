## The following two functions cache the inverse of a matrix. 

# makeCacheMatrix
# Creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
# The object does not calculate the inverse, just saves it inside.
# Saves the matrix to variable x and its inverse to variable s in scope.
# Returned object (actually it's a list) contains methods:
# set: sets matrix and resets cached inverse
# get: returns matrix
# setSolve: saves solve value
# getSolve: returns cached inverse value

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  s <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    s <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() {
    x
  }
  setSolve <- function(solve) {
    s <<- solve
  }
  getSolve <- function() {
    s
  }
  list(set = set, get = get, setSolve = setSolve, getSolve = getSolve)
}


# Function to get the inversed matrix from a special object created by makeCacheMatrix.
# Takes the object of that type as an argument 'x', checks if the inverse value is already
# cached, and if it is returns the cached value; if not, this function calculates the
# inverse for the matrix saved in the 'x', saves it into 'x' cache using method 'setSolve'
# and returns the result.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  s <- x$getSolve()
  if(!is.null(s)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(s)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  s <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setSolve(s)
  s
}
